# Extract data from Log file and Parse it using Python

### Project Description
In this project I designed a python script to parse a log file (file.log) and extract determined data for a determined fields of the file.

### Directory structure
* In /src you can find the source code of the script.
* In /output you can find an example of the output after running the script
* In /data you can find the log file to be parsed.

### How to run it
An example to run the log, can be like:
```
python getLastAlertLog.py -i ../data/alerts.log -o ../output/lastAlert.txt -d 2018/01/14
```
